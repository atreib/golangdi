At last but not at least, we're also implementing some different real-world services, as connecting with relational database (PostgreSQL), with non-relational databases (MongoDB) and some message service (probably RabbitMQ, I didn't thought about that yet)...

I think that you've already got the idea. I want to to do a few of everything using Go.
